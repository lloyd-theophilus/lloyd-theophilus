## 👨🏿‍🔬 Professional Interests

I am passionate about helping developers adopt cloud native technologies and build scalable, reliable, and secure applications. I am also a strong advocate for open source software (even though I don’t contribute as much I would like 😆) and believe that it is essential for innovation.

<h2 align="center">  <strong>I WANT TO BE THE BEST DEVELOPER ADVOCATE EVER!!!  </strong></h2> 

## 🏃🏿 Personal Interests
Aside from the world of software, I enjoy watching and playing football (soccer), listening to good music, traveling (I love airports but dread them too 😆), and having fun in my own way.

# 🫃🏿 My Work as a Cloud Native DevRel
## Technical writing
I have written over 100 technical articles for several organizations in the past 3 years and contributed to open source documentation. Below are some highlights:

1. [Case study on my work on Cilium documentation](https://cilium.io/blog/2022/11/30/cilium-google-season-of-docs-2022/)
2. [Kubernetes Sidecar Container - Best Practices with Demo (Logging with Fluentd and Amazon S3)](https://spacelift.io/blog/kubernetes-sidecar-container)
3. [How to run Minikube on an Apple M1 chip without Docker Desktop](https://everythingdevops.dev/how-to-run-minikube-on-apple-m1-chip-without-docker-desktop/)
4. [Kubernetes Secrets – How to Create, Use, and Manage](https://spacelift.io/blog/kubernetes-secrets)
5. [Building x86 Images on an Apple M1 Chip](https://everythingdevops.dev/building-x86-images-on-an-apple-m1-chip/)
6. [Jenkins in Docker: Running Docker in a Jenkins container](https://dev.to/hackmamba/jenkins-in-docker-running-docker-in-a-jenkins-container-1je)
7. [Automating Dependency Updates for Docker Projects (This content has a marketing approach to it)](https://odazie.hashnode.dev/automating-dependency-updates-for-docker-projects)

## Speaking
I have given a few talks, and below are links to some of them that showcase my speaking and presentation proficiency. I will write them in the format of {Conference}-{Talk title}.

1.  [Open Source Festival 2023 --  How Reaching Out Helped Me Grow](https://youtu.be/k-gUFkery5g?t=5463)
2.  [DoKDay at KubeCon NA 2022 -- Goals of the DoK Explorers program](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWTa-DiVljY&list=PLHgdNuGxrJt04Fwaip9aDYvXrbRSmc5HZ&index=1&t=10540s)
3.  [Ansible Contributors Summit 2022 -- How We Started the Ansible Writers Community](https://youtu.be/l9DiAYsXeM0)
4.  [Kubernetes Community Days (KCD) Africa 2022 -- Deploying Your Spring Boot Application In Amazon Managed Kubernetes Service (EKS)](https://youtu.be/m3ub01RWtZs)

## Community 
I am active in the Cloud Native and DevOps community as:

- KCD Organizer
- AWS Community Builder for the Containers Category
- Volunteer of Southern California Linux Expo (SCALE) Cloud Native Track

## Certifications
I think certificates are valuable in the cloud native world. And this is because of the knowledge gaps you fill while prepping. Below are some certificates I have earned:

- [AWS Solutions Architect - Associate](https://www.credly.com/badges/3dd05053-5d73-4802-baec-e48e9ffe4f95/public_url)
- [KCNA: Kubernetes and Cloud Native Associate](https://www.credly.com/badges/1d835115-dbf5-412d-95ec-4607baa850b2/public_url)
- Product School Masterclass: How To Build Digital Products


## 🚀 My Cloud Native Plans (Checklist) 5 Months From 22 August 2023
Below are some of my plans for the next few months as related to the [CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation)](https://cncf.io/). Will check off the items and drop notes as I achieve each.

- [ ] Write and pass the Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD) exam.
- [ ] Become a CNCF Ambassador.
- [ ] Make tons of Contributions to CNCF projects.
- [ ] Speak on "Understanding Observability in Kubernetes" at the Open Source Summit EU 2023 in Bilbao. Here is [my talk Schedule](https://sched.co/1OGeT).
- [ ] KCD Nigeria 2023 (TBD) is a Success. Currently among the organizers.
- [ ] Write at least 5 Technical tutorials on cloud native on [EverythingDevOps](https://everythingdevops.dev/).
- [ ] Speak about cloud native at more local events
- [ ] ~Speak at KubeCon. Hopefully, my talk for KubeCon NA 2023 will be accepted.~ If not, I will apply for KubeCon EU 2024. Will still apply for KubeCon EU regardless 😆.

      Sadly my KubeCon NA 2023 CFP was rejected. But heads up: Will apply to KubeCon EU 2024 😄😄 
- [ ] Write and pass the Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) exam.
- [ ] Write and pass the AWS DevOps Engineer Professional exam.
- [ ] and anything that comes around.
